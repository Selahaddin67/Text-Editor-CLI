Why use Text-Editor-CLI üß≠
Text-Editor-CLI gives you a straightforward way to work with text in the terminal. It focuses on clarity and speed. You can open a file, make edits, and run simple analyses without leaving the command line. The tool emphasizes readability and learnability, making it a good fit for coursework, coding boot camps, or solo projects.

Features ‚ú®
- Lightweight command-line interface that runs in shells like Bash, Zsh, and PowerShell.
- Fast text editing: insert, delete, replace, copy, and paste in a linear, predictable way.
- Word analysis: word count, unique word tally, most frequent words, and basic readability metrics.
- Search and replace with case sensitivity options.
- Jump to specific lines and navigate by character, word, or line.
- File processing: read and write plain text files (.txt) and support simple document formats.
- Export and import options for basic interoperability with other tools.
- Interactive help and inline tips to guide new users.
- Configurable key bindings and simple preferences.
- Cross-platform support: Linux, macOS, Windows.

Quick start üöÄ
- Install the release assets and run the program from your shell.
- Use the built-in help to learn commands quickly.
- Open a text file, edit, and analyze in a single session.

How it works üî¨
Text-Editor-CLI is built to be transparent. It stores edits in memory and writes changes back to disk when you save. Word analysis runs over the current buffer or the loaded file, giving you immediate feedback on word usage and structure. The design favors explicit actions over magic, which helps students and new developers learn how a text editor operates under the hood.

Installation and setup üõ†Ô∏è
There are two common ways to get started. The recommended approach is to install via the official release assets, which provide a ready-to-run binary or installer for your platform. The releases page is the central source for stable builds, updates, and docs. See the releases page for the exact installer file names for your OS.

- Prerequisites
  - Python 3.8+ if you choose to install from source (or use a Python package in a virtual environment).
  - Git for cloning the repository if you want to build from source.
  - A POSIX-like shell for best experience on Linux/macOS; Windows users can use PowerShell or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) for a smoother experience.

- Method 1: Install from releases (recommended)
  - Go to the official releases page: https://github.com/Selahaddin67/Text-Editor-CLI/releases
  - Download the installer or binary suitable for your platform.
  - Run the installer or execute the downloaded file according to your OS guidance.
  - After installation, run the command-line tool from your terminal as described in the quick start and help output.

- Method 2: Install from source (advanced)
  - Clone the repository:
    - git clone https://github.com/Selahaddin67/Text-Editor-CLI.git
  - Navigate to the project directory:
    - cd Text-Editor-CLI
  - Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    - python3 -m venv venv
    - source venv/bin/activate  (Linux/macOS)
    - venv\Scripts\activate     (Windows)
  - Install dependencies:
    - pip install -r requirements.txt
  - Install the package in editable mode:
    - pip install -e .
  - Run the editor (depending on the packaging, you might use a command like text-editor-cli or python -m text_editor_cli)

- Method 3: Docker (optional)
  - Run the tool in a container to avoid local dependency setup:
    - docker run --rm -it text-editor-cli:latest
  - You can mount your local workspace into the container to edit real files.

- Environment and configuration
  - The tool looks for a simple config in your home directory or the project‚Äôs config path.
  - You can customize default behavior, such as enabling word frequency analysis on load, setting the default text encoding, or altering key bindings.

Basic usage üß∞
- Start the editor with a file:
  - text-editor-cli filename.txt
  - or python -m text_editor_cli filename.txt
- Basic navigation:
  - Move through the file using arrow keys or vim-like key bindings if enabled.
  - Jump to a line with a command like :<line-number> (or a similar supported syntax).
- Editing commands:
  - i to insert text
  - Esc to exit insert mode (if using modal editing)
  - x to delete a character
  - dd to delete a line (depending on configuration)
  - y to copy, p to paste
  - u to undo, Ctrl+r to redo
- Saving and exiting:
  - :w to save
  - :q to quit
  - :wq to save and quit
- Help and built-in guidance:
  - h or help Opens the help panel with a concise command reference.
  - i for insert mode (if using a modal approach)
- Quick edit flow:
  - Open a file
  - Edit lines or insert blocks
  - Save
  - Run a quick word analysis to understand word distribution
  - Apply editing commands to improve readability
